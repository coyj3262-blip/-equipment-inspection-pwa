      <h1>Excavation and Trenching Standard Operating Procedure</h1>
      <p><strong>Weekly Review Required:</strong> Every crewmember working in or around trenches must read and acknowledge this SOP once every 7 calendar days.</p>
    </header>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Scope:</strong> Applies to all open-cut excavation, trenching for utilities, and pit excavations deeper than 4 feet on civil construction projects.
    </div>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
      <p>Provide a consistent process that prevents cave-ins, struck-by incidents, and underground utility strikes while maintaining production goals for trenching operations.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>2. Roles and Responsibilities</h2>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Competent Person</td>
          <td>Conduct soil classification, daily inspections, protective system selection, atmospheric testing in confined trenches, and stop work for unsafe conditions.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Excavator Operator</td>
          <td>Follow dig plan, maintain slope or benching, keep spoil pile 2 feet from edge, coordinate with spotter, and maintain clear swing radius.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Spotter or Labor Crew</td>
          <td>Maintain clear communication, install trench boxes or shoring, monitor water accumulation, and ensure access ladders are within 25 feet.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Project Supervisor</td>
          <td>Verify utility locates, approve protective system design, ensure competent person is assigned, and audit weekly acknowledgments.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Pre-Task Requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Call for utility locates (811 or state system) at least 72 hours prior; mark locates on the ground and on plan set.</li>
        <li>Review Job Safety Analysis (JSA) daily and confirm all crew members sign prior to starting work.</li>
        <li>Inspect excavation equipment (excavators, loaders) for leaks, proper functioning, and safety devices.</li>
        <li>Confirm trench protective system (sloping, benching, shield, shoring) is available and rated for depth and soil type.</li>
        <li>Stage dewatering pumps if water is present or forecasted; ensure discharge lines are directed away from excavation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Required PPE and Tools</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Hard hat, safety glasses with side shields, high-visibility vest, and Grade 1 protective footwear.</li>
        <li>Cut-resistant gloves, hearing protection for work near running equipment, and respiratory protection if required by atmospheric testing.</li>
        <li>Gas monitor with calibration record when entering trenches 4 feet or deeper that could accumulate hazardous atmospheres.</li>
        <li>Ladders or engineered stair systems extending 3 feet above trench edge for access and egress.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Step-by-Step Procedure</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Daily Briefing:</strong> Conduct toolbox talk, review JSA, utility map, and daily production goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Soil and Site Evaluation:</strong> Competent person classifies soil and inspects for cracks, water, surcharge loads, and adjacent structures.</li>
        <li><strong>Excavation Layout:</strong> Establish dig lines, slope limits, spoils area, and equipment travel paths using flags or paint.</li>
        <li><strong>Protective Systems:</strong> Install trench box or shoring prior to entering excavation; adjust as depth changes. Where sloping is used, maintain required angle (Type B soil: 1:1).</li>
        <li><strong>Utility Exposure:</strong> Pothole and hand-dig within 18 inches of marked utilities. Stop and notify supervisor immediately if unmarked utilities are encountered.</li>
        <li><strong>Entry and Work:</strong> Maintain ladder access every 25 feet, keep personnel clear of equipment swing radius, and prohibit working beneath suspended loads.</li>
        <li><strong>Atmospheric Monitoring:</strong> Test for oxygen, combustible gases, and toxic vapors prior to entry when required; ventilate or evacuate if levels exceed action limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Backfilling and Compaction:</strong> Place bedding material carefully around utilities, compact lift thickness per specification, and remove protective systems only when trench is safe to backfill.</li>
        <li><strong>Daily Inspections:</strong> Competent person documents inspections at start of shift, after rain events, or after any hazard-increasing occurrence.</li>
        <li><strong>Closeout:</strong> Backfill or install physical barriers if excavation left open; update as-built drawings and production logs.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Hazard Controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain spoil pile setback of at least 2 feet and use barricades when near public access.</li>
        <li>Keep heavy equipment away from trench edges beyond the angle-of-repose distance.</li>
        <li>Install trench shields to full depth; never stack mismatched boxes without engineering approval.</li>
        <li>Inspect trenches after rain, vibration, or freezing conditions; do not allow entry until competent person signs off.</li>
        <li>Restrict personnel in confined spaces when excavations reach 20 feet unless engineered shoring is installed.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Documentation and Weekly Acknowledgment</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All crew members must acknowledge this SOP weekly via the personnel management app.</li>
        <li>Supervisors verify acknowledgment status each Monday and coach any lapses prior to task assignment.</li>
        <li>File inspection forms, utility locate tickets, and dewatering logs in the project folder daily.</li>
      </ul>
