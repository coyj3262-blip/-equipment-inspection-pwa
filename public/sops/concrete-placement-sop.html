      <h1>Concrete Placement and Finishing Standard Operating Procedure</h1>
      <p><strong>Weekly Acknowledgment:</strong> Required for placement crews, pump operators, finishers, and quality control technicians.</p>
    </header>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Scope:</strong> Applies to all ready-mix concrete placements, including slabs-on-grade, structural footings, walls, pavements, and flatwork performed by company crews.

      <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
      <p>Deliver concrete placements that meet project specifications for strength, finish, and durability while controlling hydration, preventing mix contamination, and maintaining worker safety.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Pre-Pour Planning</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Review contract specifications: mix design, slump range, entrained air, reinforcement placement, tolerances, curing requirements.</li>
        <li>Verify formwork, reinforcement, embeds, and sleeves have passed inspection; ensure release agent applied.</li>
        <li>Confirm delivery sequence with batch plant (truck spacing, total yardage) and pump availability.</li>
        <li>Prepare contingency plan for weather (wind, temperature, precipitation) including accelerators, retarders, blankets, or wind breaks.</li>
        <li>Assign finishing equipment, screeds, bull floats, power trowels, and curing compounds; verify operational readiness.</li>

      <h2>4. Placement Procedure</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Arrival and Inspection:</strong> Inspect truck ticket; verify mix design, batch time, and water added. Reject loads exceeding time limits without approval.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Perform slump, temperature, and air content tests on first truck and every 50 cubic yards or per specification. Cast cylinders as required.</li>
        <li><strong>Discharge:</strong> Direct pump or chute to avoid segregation, place concrete in layers not exceeding 18 inches, and maintain uniform flow.</li>
        <li><strong>Consolidation:</strong> Use internal vibrators at one-foot spacing, insert vertically, and withdraw slowly to prevent voids. Avoid over-vibration.</li>
        <li><strong>Strike-Off:</strong> Use screed to achieve grades; check with laser or level and adjust immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Floating and Finishing:</strong> Bull float immediately after strike-off. Begin power trowel passes after bleed water dissipates. Follow specified finish (broom, trowel, exposed aggregate).</li>
        <li><strong>Jointing:</strong> Install control joints at planned locations within required time window using saws or hand tools as specified.</li>
        <li><strong>Curing:</strong> Apply curing compound or use wet curing and blankets within 30 minutes of final finish. Protect surface from rapid moisture loss.</li>
        <li><strong>Cold or Hot Weather Measures:</strong> Maintain concrete between 50°F and 70°F during curing in cold weather; use insulation blankets as needed. For hot weather, cool mix, shade placements, and use set retarders.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Safety Considerations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain exclusion zone around pump boom and outriggers; inspect for overhead power lines (minimum clearance 20 feet).</li>
        <li>Use spotters to direct trucks backing into placement area; ensure wheel chocks on slopes.</li>
        <li>Manage washout water in containment basins; never discharge to storm drains.</li>
        <li>Monitor crew for signs of heat stress or cold stress; rotate tasks and provide hydration or rest breaks.</li>
        <li>Ensure silica dust controls when saw-cutting joints, with preference for wet cutting.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Quality Verification</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Document all test results, batch ticket adjustments, and weather data on pour log.</li>
        <li>Verify reinforcement cover and embed placement prior to pour using checklists.</li>
        <li>Inspect finished surface with straightedge; identify high or low spots and correct immediately.</li>
        <li>Record curing start and end times and methods used.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Weekly Acknowledgment and Documentation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Supervisors audit acknowledgment status before scheduling personnel on concrete pours.</li>
        <li>Retain pour logs, test reports, and QA documentation with project records.</li>
        <li>Log any non-conformances, corrective actions, and lessons learned for review at weekly coordination meeting.</li>
      </ul>
